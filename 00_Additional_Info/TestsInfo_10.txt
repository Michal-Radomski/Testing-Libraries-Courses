Here are some of the best testing frameworks and libraries for testing React apps and Node/Express.js apps:

## React Testing Libraries

1. **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework that provides a test runner, assertion library, and mocking capabilities. Jest is often used in combination with other libraries for React testing.

2. **React Testing Library**: A lightweight, opinionated library for testing React components by focusing on testing the component's behavior rather than its implementation details.

3. **Enzyme**: A JavaScript testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React Components' output. It allows you to traverse, simulate, and query the output.

4. **Cypress**: An end-to-end testing framework that can be used for testing React applications. It provides a user-friendly API for simulating user interactions and making assertions.

## Node.js/Express.js Testing Libraries

1. **Mocha**: A feature-rich JavaScript test framework that runs on Node.js and in the browser. It provides a BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) style of writing tests.

2. **Jest**: Jest is also a popular choice for testing Node.js applications. It provides a test runner, assertion library, and mocking capabilities.

3. **Supertest**: A high-level abstraction for testing HTTP servers, allowing you to write tests for your Express.js APIs.

4. **Sinon**: A standalone test spies, stubs, and mocks library for JavaScript. It can be used with any testing framework, including Mocha and Jest.

5. **Chai**: A BDD / TDD assertion library for Node.js and the browser. It can be paired with any testing framework, such as Mocha or Jest.

6. **Istanbul / nyc**: Code coverage tools that measure the amount of code being exercised by tests. They can be used with any testing framework.

7. **Nock**: An HTTP mocking and expectations library for Node.js. It can be used to mock external API calls in your tests.

8. **Proxyquire**: A module to stub dependencies for testing. It allows you to override dependencies with test doubles.

9. **Testdouble.js**: A general-purpose test double library for JavaScript. It can be used to create stubs, spies, and mocks for testing.

When choosing testing libraries, consider the specific needs of your project, the size of your codebase, and the testing patterns you want to follow. Jest and React Testing Library are a popular combination for testing React apps, while Mocha, Chai, and Sinon work well together for testing Node.js/Express.js applications.
