The number of unit tests you should write for a single function can vary based on several factors, including the complexity of the function, the different scenarios it needs to handle, and the desired granularity of your tests. Here are some key points drawn from the search results:

1. **Granularity of Tests**: It's generally recommended to have one test case per logical check within a function. This approach allows for clearer identification of what specific behavior fails when a test fails. For instance, if a function has multiple conditions or outcomes, each should ideally be tested separately to maintain clarity and ease of debugging[1][4].

2. **Complex Functions**: For complex functions that handle various scenarios (e.g., different input types, edge cases), you may need multiple tests to cover all possible behaviors. Each test should focus on a specific aspect of the function's behavior, ensuring comprehensive coverage of its functionality[1][5].

3. **Avoiding Overhead**: While it's important to have thorough tests, you should also avoid unnecessary tests for trivial functions. If a function's behavior is straightforward and doesn't involve complex logic, a single test may suffice. The goal is to ensure that tests provide value without becoming burdensome[3][5].

4. **Naming and Organization**: Each test should be meaningfully named to reflect what it is testing. This practice aids in understanding the purpose of each test and simplifies the process of identifying failures[1][2].

5. **Testing Philosophy**: Some developers advocate for testing every public method or function, while others suggest focusing on critical functionalities and behaviors. The key is to balance thoroughness with maintainability, ensuring that tests are meaningful and provide useful feedback on the code's behavior[3][4].

In summary, while there is no strict rule for the number of tests per function, a good practice is to aim for one test per significant behavior or outcome, adapting the number based on the function's complexity and the specific requirements of your project.
