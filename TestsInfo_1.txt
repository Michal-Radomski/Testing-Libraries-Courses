## Types of Tests for React and Node.js Apps

When testing React and Node.js applications, it's important to cover different aspects of the codebase. Here are some common types of tests you should consider:

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components or functions in isolation[1][2]
- Ensure components render correctly and behave as expected[1][2]
- Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library for React components[1][2][4]
- Example: Test a button component to ensure it renders the correct label and triggers the expected callback when clicked[2]

### Integration Tests  
- Test how components or modules work together[1]
- Verify interactions between components and ensure they integrate properly[1]
- Example: Test a form component that includes input fields and a submit button to ensure the form data is properly handled and submitted[2]

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- Test the entire application from start to finish, simulating real user scenarios[1][2]
- Ensure the application works as expected from the user's perspective[1][2]
- Use tools like Cypress or Selenium to automate browser interactions[2]
- Example: Test the signup flow of an application by filling out the signup form, submitting it, and verifying the user is redirected to the dashboard[2]

### Snapshot Tests
- Capture the rendered output of a component and compare it to a reference snapshot[3]
- Detect unexpected changes in the component's output[3]
- Useful for catching visual regressions and ensuring consistent rendering[3]
- Example: Take a snapshot of a header component and compare it to the reference snapshot to ensure the header looks the same after changes[3]

### Smoke Tests
- Verify the basic functionality of an application or component[1]
- Ensure the application doesn't crash and basic features work as expected[1]
- Example: Render the main app component and ensure it doesn't throw any errors[1]

### Performance Tests
- Measure the performance of the application or specific components[2]
- Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the code accordingly[2]
- Use tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest to audit performance metrics[2]
- Example: Test the performance of a large list component and optimize it to ensure smooth scrolling and rendering[2]

By incorporating these different types of tests into your React and Node.js applications, you can ensure a high level of code quality, catch bugs early, and maintain the application's functionality as it evolves over time.
